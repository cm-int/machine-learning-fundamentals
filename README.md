# Machine Learning Fundamentals

This repository contains the lab instructions, demonstration scripts, Python notebooks, and data for the Machine Learning Fundamentals course.

The Python notebooks are designed to be run using the Google Colab environment.

## About the Course

This five-day instructor-led course is intended for IT professionals who wish to learn the fundamental principles of machine learning. Students are typically developers or data analysts that have some programming skills, with a mathematical background. In this course, students will learn about three classes of machine learning models: classification, clustering, and regression, together with the algorithms that underpin these models.  Students will also learn about the need for data quality, and how the correct selection of data can help to build more accurate models. Students will also learn how to test and validate models.

This course is generic, and doesnâ€™t depend on any particular platform (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud etc), but does require some basic familiarity with Python. Students should also be familiar with the use of matrices and vectors in algebra, and have some basic understanding of differential calculus, probability and statistics.

**Note:** This course focusses on the essential aspects of machine learning. It does not cover deep learning or neural networks, although the elements of this course can provide a foundation for further study in those areas.

## Audience

This course is intended for developers and analysts who are new to machine learning, want to understand how machine learning models work, and need to understand how to build high-quality models. Attendees must have some familiarity with Python, an understanding of matrix and vector arithmetic and some basic familiarity with probability, statistics, and differential calculus. 

## At Course Completion

After completing this course, students will be able to:

- Explain the uses of different types of machine learning models (classification, clustering, and regression).
- Create and test a classification machine learning model.
- Refine the quality of a classification machine learning model.
- Create, test, and refine a clustering machine learning model.
- Explain the different approaches to building a regression machine learning model (algebraic, statistical, and algorithmic).
- Build, test, and refine a linear regression machine learning model.
- Build, test, and refine a non-linear regression machine learning model.

## Prerequisites

Before attending this course, students must have:

- Familiarity with the Python programming language.
- An understanding of matrix and vector arithmetic.

1. **Introduction to Machine Learning Models**

    This module introduces machine learning together with the classification, clustering, and regression machine learning models. Students will learn the purpose of these models, and the types of problems to which students can apply them.

1. **Creating a Classification Machine Learning Model**

    This module describes different algorithms for creating a classification machine learning model, and then shows how build and test a model using Python.

1. **Refining a Machine Learning Model**

    This module explains how to refine a machine learning model, by selecting the most relevant features from the dataset, examining the distribution of values, investigating correlation between features, normalizing data, and removing bias. This module discusses issues surrounding imbalanced datasets, and how you can resolve these issues. This module also examines the precision/recall tradeoff for a model.

1. **Creating a Clustering Machine Learning Model**

    This module describes how to use a clustering model to group data, based on the features in the dataset. The module illustrates frequently-used clustering algorithms, and describes how to test and validate the models produced

1. **Using Regression to Estimate Predicted Values**

    This module explains describes the fundamental principle behind using regression to predict values given a dataset of existing information. The module shows algebraic, statistical, and algorithmic approaches, backed up with Python.

1. **Building a Linear Regression Machine Learning Model**

    This module explains how to use Linear Regression to create a machine learning model in Python.

1. **Building a Non-linear Regression Machine Learning Model**

    This module describes the difference between non-linear and linear regression, and explains how to use non-linear regression to model non-linear systems.
